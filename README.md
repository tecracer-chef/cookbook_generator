# cookbook_generator

## Summary

Placeholder Gem for Chef custom cookbook generators.

## Intention

This gem does not contain any functionality, but is intended
to be overridden by internally-served gems of the same name.

Just deploy your own generators as `cookbook_generator` on an
internal RubyGems repository and be safe of naming and versioning
conflicts as it will never hit a version 0.1.0 or higher.
